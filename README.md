This is a repository for my road to learning and developing with Python.

There are multiple folders:

1) Lessons - includes individual lessons for learning a specific concept in Python. Each concept is inside its own .py file.
2) Projects - includes all practice projects I create to solidify the lessons I've learnt and to put them into practice.
3) CustomModules - includes custom modules I created to import into my lessons or projects, as may be required by some lessons or projects.
4) PlaygroundAndTesting - a personal space to practice or recap what I've learned so far (usually empty, and changes frequently)

Eventually, after becoming more confident with my skills, there will be a folder which will include LeetCode problems and my attempts to solve them.
